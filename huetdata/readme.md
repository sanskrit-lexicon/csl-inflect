## huetdata

This directory contains documents closely derived from the published 
inflection data provided by [Gerard Huet](https://sanskrit.inria.fr/DATA/XML/).

Specifically, the file `huet_conj_tables_aor.txt` is copied from
https://github.com/funderburkjim/elispsanskrit/blob/master/huetcompare/verbs-tp-aor/huet_conj_tables_aor.txt.

This csl-inflect repository integrates Huet's aorist forms, thereby greatly
extending the number of such aorist forms previously gleaned from 
Professor Deshpande's book.
