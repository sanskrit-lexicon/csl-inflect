# verbal bases

The 'redo.sh' script recalculates the bases, based on models/calc_models.txt
```
python3 bases_test2.py ../models/calc_models.txt calc_bases.txt
```
This program uses various methods to derive the bases.
* ../pysanskrit/test2 
* benedictive_3s.txt  derived from Deshpande's table of future, conditional,
  and benedictive 3rd singular forms (p. 330-335).
* other ad-hoc methods.
