The non-genuine roots are commented out  (';not-genuine ')
There are 1403 non-genuine roots, out of 2151.  Thus, there remain
748 genuine roots in verb_cp_orig_1.txt

================================================================

There are some issues:
-  some records have duplicates in the class-pada field
   e.g. iz:29439:1P,1A,4P,4P,4A
   This should be:
   iz:29439:1P,1A,4P,4A
-  Sometimes the 'class' number is '0', as in 
   iraD:29347:0A,0P or
   I:29694:0
   These should be removed from the main file (verb_cp_0.txt)
-  Sometimes two records have the same root, due to different 'L' codes.
   Not sure whether to merge these or not, but think so
   These can be merged by having L field to be allow multiple entries,
     comma separated
   Example:
     uC:30535:1P
     uC:30536:1P
   new: uC:30535,30536:1P
-  Some have just a class, with no A or P.  Assume this means A or P
   Example: uYC:30615:1,6P
     expand to uYC:30615:1P,1A,6P

python clean.py  verb_cp_orig_1.txt verb_cp.txt
  The new file has commented lines, starting with ';'
There are 748 lines in verb_cp.txt.
Of these, 65 are commented out:
 24 have no class information ('#zero')
 41 have duplicate root information, which is merged into other elements.
This leave 682 distinctly spelled roots in verb_cp.txt.

verb_cp_deshpande_330.txt
This has 191 roots from the table in Deshpande, p. 330-335 of future,
 conditional, and benedictive.
The benedictive conjugations are restricted to this list (see models/redo.sh).

NOTE: perhaps do something similar for other 'manual' tables,
such as benedictive, perfect, etc.
